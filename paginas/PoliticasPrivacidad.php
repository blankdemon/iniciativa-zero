<h3>Onward transfers</h3>
<p>We may employ vendors to perform functions on our behalf. Examples of such  functions include&nbsp; administrative  functions, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.  These vendors are under a contractual obligation to use confidential data  received from WIKI-GLOBAL (E-COMMERCE S.A. Chile) only for purposes that fall  within the functions for which they were hired.</p>
<p>We may disclose information that we collect about you when we have reason  to believe that this is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action  against persons or entities who may be harming you, us or others. We may also  disclose information when we believe the law requires it.</p>
<p>Lineage Reports, which information on Distributors in a Distributor&rsquo;s  downline, including, but not limited to, name, address, identification number,  telephone number, email address, fax number, level or rank, volume and sales  statistics, are provided to Distributors in the strictest confidence and for  the sole purpose of supporting the Distributors to further develop their WIKI-GLOBAL  business. (The downline organization consists of all Distributors that were  personally sponsored by a particular Distributor, and in turn, all other  persons sponsored by those Distributors.)</p>
<p>Lineage Reports, including all data contained therein, constitute  confidential, proprietary trade secrets of WIKI-GLOBAL. Distributors may not  collect, distribute or gather confidential information or personal or aggregate  information about other WIKI-GLOBAL Distributors or their customers, except in  connection with their downline and solely for the purpose of promoting their WIKI-GLOBAL  business, and to manage, motivate and train their downline.</p>
<p>You need to be aware that Distributors who receive the Lineage Reports may  be based in countries that do not offer the same or a similar level of privacy  protection as is available in your own country. However, WIKI-GLOBAL will take  reasonable measures to ensure that the information is kept in confidence.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect  about you remains accurate, timely and secure. Unfortunately, no data  transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and while we  strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant its  complete security. We shall not be responsible for harm that you or any person  may suffer as a result of a breach of confidentiality in respect to your use of  the Site or any information you transmit to the Site.</p>
